  <h4>Location Visakhapatnam One Town Police Station</h4> 
Today went OneTown police station regarding which i Complain yesterday to collectrete yester day siad may call tomorrow so they call & i went. Here assusal comedy police are not looking to my complaint trying to conflict. Conflict is where I take pics of police station arguing regarding it. I had simply questioned why dont take pics in govt offices. Is it due to fake employees or workers being identified in pics or if employees found as criminals will conform their photos by these pics? Because most of the Govt places are restricting to capture more why don't you have access to public for public places? at the time one senior journalist tried to dominate or influence the matter. I asked his name and media name and he answered name and regretted the media name and even his phone number also. I questioned regarding current affairs in india he became calm. I explained reason regarding capture and senior journalist also supported me with his silent punch called dont take pictures bro if you take pictures it will be found her not even available of water. Which is a basic need for all but not available here. Visakha is going worst. And mean while I am explaining my complaint to cop most of all are trying to divert i address to him and he smiled. growing mafia even in police stations.. <img src="cinqueterre.jpg" class="img-rounded" alt="Cinque Terre">
