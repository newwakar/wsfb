  <h4> Here i met Collector and argued with Assistant Collector regarding his tolerance of grievances. I question directly to the assistant collector regarding how many days the lagging process of grievances takes and how long we face financial trouble due to your Visakha Mafia, and why don't you take any action regarding the complaint?
Even the assistant collector behaved worstly, and cops reached me. I argued with them, and I came down to the building. Here, local media was there. I approached them, I explained the issue, and they took my interview for their channel. Local people also hesitated by the collector, and they appreciated me for showing guts against the assistant collector, where cops surrounded and argued with them. People saw that, and they appreciated it.    <iframe width="420" height="315"
