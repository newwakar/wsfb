  <h4> Advocate Uma Devi and Her Cunningness
<br>
I left one company due to my struggle with the company. After that, I found they were still following me, and they troubled my family with family issues, and my mother approached advocate Umadevi, and she intentionally wasted my money more than 800,000 rupee and I complained regarding it to the BAR Association & even the collector, but they have not taken any action, even with the evidence.
<br>
In the year 2009, I worked for one company, and they intentionally terminated me, and after I didn't get a job anywhere, even if any were given, they terminated me in two to three months, and my mother blamed me, as I am wrong due to Advocate Umadevi's advice. I told her more times regarding if any company terminates, it's not my fault because companies are bad. If it's a good company, they will definitely take an exit interview to know why the employee left because of salary or management wrong to improve company wealth, but till my companies are not done, so don't blame. Everywhere I found mafia, and they were troubled. Even when I came home, my mother went to Advocate House. I hesitated and asked why she went there. She did not respond to me and wasted my money through unnecessary investment in my home by Vastu and lost my money even though she borrowed more than 7.5 lakhs from my relatives, and now they simply say, We are not your relatives, and we did not give you any money. Then I understood it is a mafia. Because I have been running freelance media and addressing crimes in India since 2009, every time the mafia troubles me, but recently I discussed the Kolkata Rape Case, which is not rape; it's biological research being done there because, as of our investigation, Corona spread from India, and for Corona, India invited generic medicine to get cheap pharma companies. After Corona, India led in the Corona vaccine and sold it for Crores of rupees unofficially. After corona also, they are continuing for the new virus. The same thing I discuss online, and then again, the mafia is attacking me. In 2009, I worked at a company that also had this same political mafia, and the same political party member was Advocate Umadevi. And some of my friends also indirectly warned me and hinted at the old company. 
<br>
Even Visakha people can observe how much traffic there is in the city without jobs, businesses, or income. They have vehicles and are horning on empty roads. Even cops are doing the same, which I published on my webpage: <a href="https://visakhamafia.wlite.in/"> https://visakhamafia.wlite.in/</a>
