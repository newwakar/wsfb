  <h4>Location Visakhapatnam Collectorate</h4> 
  
    You can find the audio of the Distract Collector Office for people awaiting and grievances of more than 50 every week and people complain regarding real estate kubjas and Municipality Corruption by Visakha people. No one can understand what is happening in Visakha. Because even Collector responses are also not fair and people also complain and go from their. No information regarding how many grievances received or which are solved In. Moreover Visakha Mafia was even found in front of the Collector because he was assigned to the Police regarding my Complaint While I was talking to police Some one intentionally broke by flow of express regarding complaint and i requested for wait until one completes then you can talk with police. And it's not the first time every time i am talking with anyone where Someone will intentionally break my conversations and I have left the location. You can check the same which i had published regarding Visakha Mafia Support from Police -Jurnal. And Collectorate police authorities also forwarded the grievance to One Town Police where they had already seen their involvement in Visakha Mafia or Crimes. But I had to go to the One Town Police station and talk regarding grievances which i had submitted in Collectrate.
